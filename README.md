While rereading _The Recursive Universe: Cosmic Complexity and the Limits of
Scientific Knowledge_ written by William Poundstone in 1985, I decided to give
[Conway's Game of Life](http://www.conwaylife.com/) a try
in [Clojure](https://clojure.org).

To start, install [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org) and run `lein run`.
